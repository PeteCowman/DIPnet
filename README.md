These are script I have written as part of a collaborative NEScent Project "Diversity in the Indo-Pacific"

They include scripts for manipulating data files containing population diversity statsitics from the database.

The eventual aim will be ti build these scripts into an R package to access the database to pull down
data for species and/or regions
